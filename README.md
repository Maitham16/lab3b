In this project, I have implemented the following tasks:

Tasks:
1. Task 1 (T1): Fully implemented.
2. Task 2 (T2): Fully implemented.
3. Task 3 (T3): Fully implemented.
4. Task 4 (T4): fully implemented.
5. Task 5 (T5): fully implemented.
6. Task 6 (T6): Fully implemented.
7. Task 7 (T7): I managed to parse it but I could not figured out why the
                expected output is not presented. (I guess I have to implement 
                a vector for objects).

Effects:
1.EF1: Bump Mapping: I read about it and implemented it but I am not sure
                     whether it is correct or not.
2.EF5: Depth of field & real camera lense: I get nice focused picture but still
                    not sure whether it is correct or not.
3.EF8: Spot light sources: fully implemented

Bonus:
B6: antialiasing using supersampling: fully implemented.
