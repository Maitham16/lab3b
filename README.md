Claim
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In this project, I have implemented the following tasks:

Tasks:
1. Task 1 (T1): Fully implemented.
2. Task 2 (T2): Fully implemented.
3. Task 3 (T3): Fully implemented.
4. Task 4 (T4): fully implemented.
5. Task 5 (T5): fully implemented.
6. Task 6 (T6): Fully implemented.
7. Task 7 (T7): I managed to parse it but I could not figured out why the
                expected output is not presented. (I guess I have to implement 
                a vector for objects).

Effects:
1.EF1: Bump Mapping: I read about it and implemented it but I am not sure
                     whether it is correct or not.
2.EF5: Depth of field & real camera lense: I get nice focused picture but still
                    not sure whether it is correct or not.
3.EF8: Spot light sources: fully implemented

Bonus:
B6: antialiasing using supersampling: fully implemented.

Execution Remarks
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- The present execution remarks delineate the advancements made in response to 
the previous feedback. All assigned tasks have been successfully integrated into
a the main function. Upon executing the code, the user will be prompted to input 
a number ranging from 1 to 9, corresponding to the exampleN.xml file, where N 
denotes a digit from 1 to 9. 
- Additionally, users are required to indicate their preference regarding turn
on/off camera transformations, and camera lens.
- Please make sure to type y or n to get the expected output.
- Please turn on/off the spotlight from the main function by changing the value
  of isSpotlight true/false, I have set it to false by default.
- if you receive (Segmentation fault (core dumped)), please try
  again. That is maybe because I have not dealt with memory management well.
  Once, the operations are quick that happens.

Tested Environments
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Development Computer:
- OS: Fedora 38 64-bit
- Built in Image Viewer

Test Computer:
- Almighty
- same development computer

Resources
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. scenes examples folder from course website.
2. pugixml library from https://pugixml.org/
3. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30198520/class-with-union-use-of-deleted-function-on-constructor

Additional and General Remarks
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. I utilized ChatGPT to check errors codes, and to solve them. Also, I pasted some functions for corrections.
2. I searched the internet to resolve errors and I got numerous ideas that I applied into my code.
3. Several ideas from youtube's tutorials are applied into my project.
4. No direct code copied but I commented when I get the same function structure from the internet.
